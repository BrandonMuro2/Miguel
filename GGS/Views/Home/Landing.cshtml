                    <p class="card-text">
                        An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in the brain using small metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp. Brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even during sleep. This activity appears as waves on an EEG.

                        For a long time, it has been recognized that the brain is the center of intellectual activity, a vast and intricate domain that still holds countless mysteries and secrets. Over a century ago, Golgi and Ramón y Cajal made groundbreaking discoveries about the intricate branching of nerve cells and their connections, known as synapses. Since then, the field of neuroscience has made remarkable strides, although we are still far from unraveling the complexities of brain function.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Mathematical activity primarily takes place in the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain, as suggested by the theory of brain localization. Specifically, within the parietal lobe, the intraparietal sulcus and the inferior region show increased energy consumption during mathematical tasks (Fernández Bravo, 2010). The control of mathematical thinking and visuospatial cognitive ability is attributed to the inferior parietal region. Current knowledge indicates that complex mathematical processing tasks involve the collaboration of multiple brain lobes.

                        Even solving a simple arithmetic problem requires the utilization of verbal, spatial, conceptual, and arithmetic skills (Fernández Bravo, 2010). The origins of human mathematical ability have been debated among scientists for a long time. Some hypotheses suggest that the ability for calculation is related to language skills, while others propose that it is based on the innate knowledge of space, time, and numbers that Homo sapiens possess (Sinc, 2016).

                        This study leverages an existing EEG database collected by Igor Zyma, Sergii Tukaev, and Ivan Seleznov, which includes EEG recordings of subjects performing mental arithmetic tasks. Each subject was evaluated under two conditions: a baseline (Normal) and while performing mathematical operations (Performing Operations). The sample is divided into two groups, one high-performing (Group "G") and one low-performing (Group "B"), providing a rich opportunity to explore the neurocognitive differences underlying various levels of mathematical ability.
